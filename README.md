# Elevator Simulation

## Project Overview

The Elevator Simulation System is a console application developed in C# that simulates the movement of elevators within a large building. The primary goal is to optimize passenger transportation efficiently while adhering to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for modularity and maintainability.

### Required Features:
The console application will include the following key features:

1. Real-Time Elevator Status:

    Display the real-time status of each elevator, including its current floor, direction of movement, whether it's in motion or stationary, and the number of passengers it is carrying.
2. Interactive Elevator Control:

    Allow users to interact with the elevators through the console application. Users should be able
    to call an elevator to a specific floor and indicate the number of passengers waiting on each floor.

3. Multiple Floors and Elevators Support
    
    Design the application to accommodate buildings with multiple floors and multiple elevators.
    Ensure that elevators can efficiently move between different floors.

4. Efficient Elevator Dispatching:

    Implement an algorithm that efficiently directs the nearest available elevator to respond to an
    elevator request. Minimize wait times for passengers and optimize elevator usage.

5. Passenger Limit Handling:

    Consider the maximum passenger limit for each elevator. Prevent the elevator from becoming
    overloaded and handle scenarios where additional elevators might be required.

6. Consideration for Different Elevator Types:

    Although the challenge focuses on passenger elevators, consider the existence of other elevator
    types, such as high-speed elevators, glass elevators, and freight elevators. Plan the application's
    architecture to accommodate future extension for these types.

7. Real-Time Operation:

    Ensure that the console application operates in real-time, providing immediate responses to user
    interactions and accurately reflecting elevator movements and status.
